12631,"Title: Smoothing Spline ANOVA with Component-Wise Bayesian ""Confidence Intervals"" To Appear, J. Computational and Graphical Statistics","Abstract: We study a multivariate smoothing spline estimate of a function of several variables, based on an ANOVA decomposition as sums of main effect functions (of one variable), two-factor interaction functions (of two variables), etc. We derive the Bayesian ""confidence intervals"" for the components of this decomposition and demonstrate that, even with multiple smoothing parameters, they can be efficiently computed using the publicly available code RKPACK, which was originally designed just to compute the estimates. We carry out a small Monte Carlo study to see how closely the actual properties of these component-wise confidence intervals match their nominal confidence levels. Lastly, we analyze some lake acidity data as a function of calcium concentration, latitude, and longitude, using both polynomial and thin plate spline main effects in the same model.",Neural_Networks
6898,Title: Sample Size Calculations for Smoothing Splines Based on Bayesian Confidence Intervals,"Abstract: Bayesian confidence intervals of a smoothing spline are often used to distinguish two curves. In this paper, we provide an asymptotic formula for sample size calculations based on Bayesian confidence intervals. Approximations and simulations on special functions indicate that this asymptotic formula is reasonably accurate. Key Words: Bayesian confidence intervals; sample size; smoothing spline. fl Address: Department of Statistics and Applied Probability, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106-3110.

78994,Title: Adaptive tuning of numerical weather prediction models: Randomized GCV in three and four dimensional data assimilation,"Abstract: This article describes a new system for induction of oblique decision trees. This system, OC1, combines deterministic hill-climbing with two forms of randomization to find a good oblique split (in the form of a hyperplane) at each node of a decision tree. Oblique decision tree methods are tuned especially for domains in which the attributes are numeric, although they can be adapted to symbolic or mixed symbolic/numeric attributes. We present extensive empirical studies, using both real and artificial data, that analyze OC1's ability to construct oblique trees that are smaller and more accurate than their axis-parallel counterparts. We also examine the benefits of randomization for the construction of oblique decision trees.",Neural_Networks
