954315,1155073,Title: Inductive Database Design,Title: Learning with Abduction,"Abstract: When designing a (deductive) database, the designer has to decide for each predicate (or relation) whether it should be defined extensionally or intensionally, and what the definition should look like. An intelligent system is presented to assist the designer in this task. It starts from an example database in which all predicates are defined extensionally. It then tries to compact the database by transforming extensionally defined predicates into intensionally defined ones. The intelligent system employs techniques from the area of inductive logic programming.","Abstract: We investigate how abduction and induction can be integrated into a common learning framework through the notion of Abductive Concept Learning (ACL). ACL is an extension of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to the case in which both the background and the target theory are abductive logic programs and where an abductive notion of entailment is used as the coverage relation. In this framework, it is then possible to learn with incomplete information about the examples by exploiting the hypothetical reasoning of abduction. The paper presents the basic framework of ACL with its main characteristics and illustrates its potential in addressing several problems in ILP such as learning with incomplete information and multiple predicate learning. An algorithm for ACL is developed by suitably extending the top-down ILP method for concept learning and integrating this with an abductive proof procedure for Abductive Logic Programming (ALP). A prototype system has been developed and applied to learning problems with incomplete information. The particular role of integrity constraints in ACL is investigated showing ACL as a hybrid learning framework that integrates the explanatory (discriminant) and descriptive (characteristic) settings of ILP.",Rule_Learning,Rule_Learning,"[[6923, 6923, 20857, 72908, 72908, 83461], [1155073, 20857, 1155073, 6923, 954315, 954315]]","[[1272, 2440, 2440, 6923, 6923, 20857, 63486, 72908, 72908, 83461], [6923, 6923, 72908, 1155073, 20857, 1155073, 83461, 6923, 954315, 954315]]","[['Title: Inductive Constraint Logic, category:Rule_Learning', 'Title: Inductive Constraint Logic, category:Rule_Learning', 'Title: The ILP description learning problem: Towards a general model-level definition of data mining in ILP, category:Rule_Learning', 'Title: Applications of a logical discovery engine, category:Rule_Learning', 'Title: Applications of a logical discovery engine, category:Rule_Learning', 'Title: Dlab: A Declarative Language Bias Formalism, category:Rule_Learning'], ['Title: Learning with Abduction, category:Rule_Learning', 'Title: The ILP description learning problem: Towards a general model-level definition of data mining in ILP, category:Rule_Learning', 'Title: Learning with Abduction, category:Rule_Learning', 'Title: Inductive Constraint Logic, category:Rule_Learning', 'Title: Inductive Database Design, category:Rule_Learning', 'Title: Inductive Database Design, category:Rule_Learning']]","[['Title: Learning a set of primitive actions with an Induction of decision trees.

Many simulation algorithms deliver (approximate) samples of such random set models, for example by simulating the equilibrium distribution of a Markov chain such as a spatial birth-and-death process. The samples usually fail to be exact because the algorithm simulates the Markov chain for a long but finite time, and thus convergence to equilibrium is only approximate. The seminal work by Propp and Wilson made an important contribution to simulation by proposing a coupling method, Coupling from the Past (CFTP), which delivers perfect, that is to say exact, simulations of Markov chains. In this paper we introduce this new idea of perfect simulation and illustrate it using two common models in stochastic geometry: the dead leaves model and a Boolean model conditioned to cover a finite set of points.",Neural_Networks,Probabilistic_Methods,"[[38537, 38537, 137868, 645084, 645088, 645088], [1131277, 137868, 1131277, 1131277, 1131277, 645084]]","[[38537, 38537, 38537, 137868, 153063, 642641, 645084, 645088, 645088], [1131277, 137868, 153063, 1131277, 645084, 645084, 1131277, 1131277, 645084]]","[['Title: BAYESIAN STATISTICS 6, pp. 000--000  Exact sampling for Bayesian inference: towards general purpose algorithms, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: BAYESIAN STATISTICS 6, pp. 000--000  Exact sampling for Bayesian inference: towards general purpose algorithms, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: On Bayesian analysis of mixtures with an unknown number of components  Summary, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: Modelling Risk from a Disease in Time and Space, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Mapping of Disease Rates, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Mapping of Disease Rates, category:Probabilistic_Methods'], ['Title: Bayesian Detection of Clusters and Discontinuities in Disease Maps, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: On Bayesian analysis of mixtures with an unknown number of components  Summary, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: Bayesian Detection of Clusters and Discontinuities in Disease Maps, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: Bayesian Detection of Clusters and Discontinuities in Disease Maps, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: Bayesian Detection of Clusters and Discontinuities in Disease Maps, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: Modelling Risk from a Disease in Time and Space, category:Probabilistic_Methods']]","[['Title: BAYESIAN STATISTICS 6, pp. 000--000  Exact sampling for Bayesian inference: towards general purpose algorithms, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: BAYESIAN STATISTICS 6, pp. 000--000  Exact sampling for Bayesian inference: towards general purpose algorithms, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: BAYESIAN STATISTICS 6, pp. 000--000  Exact sampling for Bayesian inference: towards general purpose algorithms, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: On Bayesian analysis of mixtures with an unknown number of components  Summary, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: Bayesian Forecasting of Multinomial Time Series through Conditionally Gaussian Dynamic Models, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: Bayesian Analysis of Agricultural Field Experiments, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: Modelling Risk from a Disease in Time and Space, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Mapping of Disease Rates, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Mapping of Disease Rates, category:Probabilistic_Methods'], ['Title: Bayesian Detection of Clusters and Discontinuities in Disease Maps, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: On Bayesian analysis of mixtures with an unknown number of components  Summary, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: Bayesian Forecasting of Multinomial Time Series through Conditionally Gaussian Dynamic Models, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: Bayesian Detection of Clusters and Discontinuities in Disease Maps, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: Modelling Risk from a Disease in Time and Space, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: Modelling Risk from a Disease in Time and Space, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: Bayesian Detection of Clusters and Discontinuities in Disease Maps, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: Bayesian Detection of Clusters and Discontinuities in Disease Maps, category:Probabilistic_Methods', 'Title: Modelling Risk from a Disease in Time and Space, category:Probabilistic_Methods']]",0,0,0,0,0

If the state of the world is known at all times, the world can be modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). MDPs have been studied extensively and many methods are known for determining optimal courses of action, or policies. The more realistic case where state information is only partially observable, Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), have received much less attention. The best exact algorithms for these problems can be very inefficient in both space and time.

Recently, a number of researchers have empirically demonstrated good performance of these same algorithms on networks with loops, but a theoretical understanding of this performance has yet to be achieved. Here we lay a foundation for an understanding of belief propagation in networks with loops. For networks with a single loop, we derive an analytical relationship between the steady state beliefs in the loopy network and the true posterior probability. Using this relationship we show a category of networks for which the MAP estimate obtained by belief update and by belief revision can be proven to be optimal (although the beliefs will be incorrect). We show how nodes can use local information in the messages they receive in order to correct the steady state beliefs. Furthermore we prove that for all networks with a single loop, the MAP estimate obtained by belief revision at convergence is guaranteed to give the globally optimal sequence of states. The result is independent of the length of the cycle and the size of the state space. For networks with multiple loops, we introduce the concept of a ""balanced network"" and show simulation results comparing belief revision and update in such networks. We show that the Turbo code structure is balanced and present simulations on a toy Turbo code problem indicating the decoding obtained by belief revision at convergence is significantly more likely to be correct.

However, these techniques often retain the entire training set in memory, resulting in large memory requirements and slow execution speed, as well as a sensitivity to noise. This paper provides a discussion of issues related to reducing the number of instances retained in memory while maintaining (and sometimes improving) generalization accuracy, and mentions algorithms other researchers have used to address this problem. It presents three intuitive noise-tolerant algorithms that can be used to prune instances from the training set.

We also speculate on how the neural network method can be used to disentangle different hadronization schemes by compressing the dimensionality of the state space of hadrons.","Abstract: We present a model of similarity-based retrieval which attempts to capture three psychological phenomena: (1) people are extremely good at judging similarity and analogy when given items to compare. (2) Superficial remindings are much more frequent than structural remindings. (3) People sometimes experience and use purely structural analogical re-mindings. Our model, called MAC/FAC (for ""many are called but few are chosen"") consists of two stages. The first stage (MAC) uses a computationally cheap, non-structural matcher to filter candidates from a pool of memory items. That is, we redundantly encode structured representations as content vectors, whose dot product yields an estimate of how well the corresponding structural representations will match. The second stage (FAC) uses SME to compute a true structural match between the probe and output from the first stage. MAC/FAC has been fully implemented, and we show that it is capable of modeling patterns of access found in psychological data.",Neural_Networks,Case_Based,"[[20193, 20193, 20193, 566653, 566653, 566664, 853115], [3085, 566653, 566664, 3085, 566664, 3085, 853114]]","[[10798, 20193, 20193, 20193, 566653, 566653, 566664, 853115], [20193, 3085, 566653, 566664, 3085, 566664, 3085, 853114]]","[['Title: The Structure-Mapping Engine: Algorithm and Examples, category:Case_Based', 'Title: The Structure-Mapping Engine: Algorithm and Examples, category:Case_Based', 'Title: The Structure-Mapping Engine: Algorithm and Examples, category:Case_Based', 'Title: Proceedings of CogSci89 Structural Evaluation of Analogies: What Counts?, category:Case_Based', 'Title: Proceedings of CogSci89 Structural Evaluation of Analogies: What Counts?, category:Case_Based', 'Title: Making SME greedy and pragmatic, category:Case_Based', 'Title: LU TP 90-3 Finding Gluon Jets with a Neural Trigger, category:Neural_Networks'], ['Title: MAC/FAC: A Model of Similarity-based Retrieval, category:Case_Based', 'Title: Proceedings of CogSci89 Structural Evaluation of Analogies: What Counts?, category:Case_Based', 'Title: Making SME greedy and pragmatic, category:Case_Based', 'Title: MAC/FAC: A Model of Similarity-based Retrieval, category:Case_Based', 'Title: Making SME greedy and pragmatic, category:Case_Based', 'Title: MAC/FAC: A Model of Similarity-based Retrieval, category:Case_Based', 'Title: Using Neural Networks to Identify Jets, category:Neural_Networks']]","[['Title: Learning physical descriptions from functional definitions, examples, Learning from examples: The effect of different conceptual, category:Case_Based', 'Title: The Structure-Mapping Engine: Algorithm and Examples, category:Case_Based', 'Title: The Structure-Mapping Engine: Algorithm and Examples, category:Case_Based', 'Title: The Structure-Mapping Engine: Algorithm and Examples, category:Case_Based', 'Title: Proceedings of CogSci89 Structural Evaluation of Analogies: What Counts?, category:Case_Based', 'Title: Proceedings of CogSci89 Structural Evaluation of Analogies: What Counts?, category:Case_Based', 'Title: Making SME greedy and pragmatic, category:Case_Based', 'Title: LU TP 90-3 Finding Gluon Jets with a Neural Trigger, category:Neural_Networks'], ['Title: The Structure-Mapping Engine: Algorithm and Examples, category:Case_Based', 'Title: MAC/FAC: A Model of Similarity-based Retrieval, category:Case_Based', 'Title: Proceedings of CogSci89 Structural Evaluation of Analogies: What Counts?, category:Case_Based', 'Title: Making SME greedy and pragmatic, category:Case_Based', 'Title: MAC/FAC: A Model of Similarity-based Retrieval, category:Case_Based', 'Title: Making SME greedy and pragmatic, category:Case_Based', 'Title: MAC/FAC: A Model of Similarity-based Retrieval, category:Case_Based', 'Title: Using Neural Networks to Identify Jets, category:Neural_Networks']]",0,0,0,0,0

The bounds apply when in-sample and out-of-sample data are drawn from the same distribution. Partition-based bounds are stronger than VC-type bounds, but they require more computation.","Abstract: We extend Hoeffding bounds to develop superior probabilistic performance guarantees for accurate classifiers. The original Hoeffding bounds on classifier accuracy depend on the accuracy itself as a parameter. Since the accuracy is not known a priori, the parameter value that gives the weakest bounds is used. We present a method that loosely bounds the accuracy using the old method and uses the loose bound as an improved parameter value for tighter bounds. We show how to use the bounds in practice, and we generalize the bounds for individual classifiers to form uniform bounds over multiple classifiers.",Theory,Theory,"[[753047, 753047, 753047, 753047, 753070, 753070, 753070, 753264, 753264], [1136631, 753070, 753264, 767763, 753047, 753264, 767763, 753047, 767763]]","[[175548, 753047, 753047, 753047, 753047, 753047, 753070, 753070, 753070, 753264, 753264, 753265], [753070, 1136631, 753070, 753264, 753265, 767763, 753047, 753264, 767763, 753047, 767763, 753047]]","[['Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: Similar Classifiers and VC Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Similar Classifiers and VC Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Similar Classifiers and VC Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Improved Uniform Test Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Improved Uniform Test Error Bounds, category:Theory'], ['Title: Improved Hoeffding-Style Performance Guarantees for Accurate Classifiers, category:Theory', 'Title: Similar Classifiers and VC Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Improved Uniform Test Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Partition-Based Uniform Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: Improved Uniform Test Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Partition-Based Uniform Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: Partition-Based Uniform Error Bounds, category:Theory']]","[['Title: Neural Networks with Quadratic VC Dimension, category:Neural_Networks', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: Similar Classifiers and VC Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Similar Classifiers and VC Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Similar Classifiers and VC Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Improved Uniform Test Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Improved Uniform Test Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Validation of Average Error Rate Over Classifiers, category:Neural_Networks'], ['Title: Similar Classifiers and VC Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Improved Hoeffding-Style Performance Guarantees for Accurate Classifiers, category:Theory', 'Title: Similar Classifiers and VC Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Improved Uniform Test Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Validation of Average Error Rate Over Classifiers, category:Neural_Networks', 'Title: Partition-Based Uniform Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: Improved Uniform Test Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Partition-Based Uniform Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: Partition-Based Uniform Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory']]",1,1,1,1,1

This phenomenon hurts the forward propagation of long-term context information, as well as learning a hidden state representation to represent long-term context, which depends on propagating credit information backwards in time. Using results from Markov chain theory, we show that this problem of diffusion of context and credit is reduced when the transition probabilities approach 0 or 1, i.e., the transition probability matrices are sparse and the model essentially deterministic. The results found in this paper apply to learning approaches based on continuous optimization, such as gradient descent and the Baum-Welch algorithm.",Theory,Neural_Networks,"[[29492, 753047, 753047, 753047, 753070, 753070, 753070, 753264, 753264], [29708, 753070, 753264, 767763, 753047, 753264, 767763, 753047, 767763]]","[[29492, 175548, 753047, 753047, 753047, 753047, 753070, 753070, 753070, 753264, 753264, 753265], [29708, 753070, 753070, 753264, 753265, 767763, 753047, 753264, 767763, 753047, 767763, 753047]]","[['Title: Induction of Multiscale Temporal Structure, category:Neural_Networks', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: Similar Classifiers and VC Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Similar Classifiers and VC Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Similar Classifiers and VC Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Improved Uniform Test Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Improved Uniform Test Error Bounds, category:Theory'], ['Title: Diffusion of Context and Credit Information in Markovian Models, category:Neural_Networks', 'Title: Similar Classifiers and VC Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Improved Uniform Test Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Partition-Based Uniform Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: Improved Uniform Test Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Partition-Based Uniform Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: Partition-Based Uniform Error Bounds, category:Theory']]","[['Title: Induction of Multiscale Temporal Structure, category:Neural_Networks', 'Title: Neural Networks with Quadratic VC Dimension, category:Neural_Networks', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: Similar Classifiers and VC Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Similar Classifiers and VC Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Similar Classifiers and VC Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Improved Uniform Test Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Improved Uniform Test Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Validation of Average Error Rate Over Classifiers, category:Neural_Networks'], ['Title: Diffusion of Context and Credit Information in Markovian Models, category:Neural_Networks', 'Title: Similar Classifiers and VC Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Similar Classifiers and VC Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Improved Uniform Test Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Validation of Average Error Rate Over Classifiers, category:Neural_Networks', 'Title: Partition-Based Uniform Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: Improved Uniform Test Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: Partition-Based Uniform Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory', 'Title: Partition-Based Uniform Error Bounds, category:Theory', 'Title: The Central Classifier Bound ANew Error Bound for the Classifier Chosen by Early Stopping Key, category:Theory']]",0,0,0,0,0
