32083,Title: Back Propagation is Sensitive to Initial Conditions,"Abstract: This paper explores the effect of initial weight selection on feed-forward networks learning simple functions with the back-propagation technique. We first demonstrate, through the use of Monte Carlo techniques, that the magnitude of the initial condition vector (in weight space) is a very significant parameter in convergence time variability. In order to further understand this result, additional deterministic experiments were performed. The results of these experiments demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of back propagation to initial weight configuration.",Neural_Networks,"Back propagation, initial weight selection, feed-forward networks, convergence time, Monte Carlo experiments, deterministic experiments.","Title: 4 Implementing Application Specific Routines Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning.

273152,Title: Evolutionary Module Acquisition,"Abstract: A critical issue for users of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in applications is how to determine when it is safe to stop sampling and use the samples to estimate characteristics of the distribution of interest. Research into methods of computing theoretical convergence bounds holds promise for the future but currently has yielded relatively little that is of practical use in applied work. Consequently, most MCMC users address the convergence problem by applying diagnostic tools to the output produced by running their samplers. After giving a brief overview of the area, we provide an expository review of thirteen convergence diagnostics, describing the theoretical basis and practical implementation of each. We then compare their performance in two simple models and conclude that all the methods can fail to detect the sorts of convergence failure they were designed to identify. We thus recommend a combination of strategies aimed at evaluating and accelerating MCMC sampler convergence, including applying diagnostic procedures to a small number of parallel chains, monitoring autocorrelations and cross-correlations, and modifying parameterizations or sampling algorithms appropriately. We emphasize, however, that it is not possible to say with certainty that a finite sample from an MCMC algorithm is representative of an underlying stationary distribution.

35061,Title: Evolving Networks: Using the Genetic Algorithm with Connectionist Learning,"Abstract: A pilot study is described on the practical application of artificial neural networks. The limit cycle of the attitude control of a satellite is selected as the test case. One of the sources of the limit cycle is a position dependent error in the observed attitude. A Reinforcement Learning method is selected, which is able to adapt a controller such that a cost function is optimised. An estimate of the cost function is learned by a neural `critic'. In our approach, the estimated cost function is directly represented as a function of the parameters of a linear controller. The critic is implemented as a CMAC network. Results from simulations show that the method is able to find optimal parameters without unstable behaviour. In particular in the case of large discontinuities in the attitude measurements, the method shows a clear improvement compared to the conventional approach: the RMS attitude error decreases approximately 30%.",Genetic_Algorithms,"Artificial neural networks, attitude control, satellite, Reinforcement Learning, neural critic, CMAC network, optimization, stability in simulations.","Title: 4 Implementing Application Specific Routines Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning.

44514,Title: The Observers Paradox: Apparent Computational Complexity in Physical Systems,"Abstract: Many connectionist approaches to musical expectancy and music composition let the question of What next? overshadow the equally important question of When next?. One cannot escape the latter question, one of temporal structure, when considering the perception of musical meter. We view the perception of metrical structure as a dynamic process where the temporal organization of external musical events synchronizes, or entrains, a listeners internal processing mechanisms. This article introduces a novel connectionist unit, based upon a mathematical model of entrainment, capable of phase and frequency-locking to periodic components of incoming rhythmic patterns. Networks of these units can self-organize temporally structured responses to rhythmic patterns. The resulting network behavior embodies the perception of metrical structure. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of our approach for theories of metrical structure and musical expectancy.",Neural_Networks,"Connectionist approaches, musical expectancy, temporal structure perception, musical meter, connectionist unit, rhythmic patterns, self-organization, metrical structure theories.","Title: 4 Implementing Application Specific Routines Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning.

Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.","Abstract: To implement a specific application, you should only have to change the file app.c. Section 2 describes the routines in app.c in detail. If you use additional variables for your specific problem, the easiest method of making them available to other program units is to declare them in sga.h and external.h. However, take care that you do not redeclare existing variables. Two example applications files are included in the SGA-C distribution. The file app1.c performs the simple example problem included with the Pascal version; finding the maximum of x 10 , where x is an integer interpretation of a chromosome. A slightly more complex application is include in app2.c. This application illustrates two features that have been added to SGA-C. The first of these is the ithruj2int function, which converts bits i through j in a chromosome to an integer. The second new feature is the utility pointer that is associated with each population member. The example application interprets each chromosome as a set of concatenated integers in binary form. The lengths of these integer fields is determined by the user-specified value of field size, which is read in by the function app data(). The field size must be less than the smallest of the chromosome length and the length of an unsigned integer. An integer array for storing the interpreted form of each chromosome is dynamically allocated and assigned to the chromosome's utility pointer in app malloc(). The ithruj2int routine (see utility.c) is used to translate each chromosome into its associated vector. The fitness for each chromosome is simply the sum of the squares of these integers. This example application will function for any chromosome length. SGA-C is intended to be a simple program for first-time GA experimentation. It is not intended to be definitive in terms of its efficiency or the grace of its implementation. The authors are interested in the comments, criticisms, and bug reports from SGA-C users, so that the code can be refined for easier use in subsequent versions.

210872,Title: An Evolutionary Algorithm that Constructs Recurrent Neural Networks,"Abstract: Standard methods for inducing both the structure and weight values of recurrent neural networks fit an assumed class of architectures to every task. This simplification is necessary because the interactions between network structure and function are not well understood. Evolutionary computation, which includes genetic algorithms and evolutionary programming, is a population-based search method that has shown promise in such complex tasks. This paper argues that genetic algorithms are inappropriate for network acquisition and describes an evolutionary program, called GNARL, that simultaneously acquires both the structure and weights for recurrent networks. This algorithms empirical acquisition method allows for the emergence of complex behaviors and topologies that are potentially excluded by the artificial architectural constraints imposed in standard network induction methods.",Genetic_Algorithms,"Recurrent neural networks, genetic algorithms, evolutionary computation, GNARL, network acquisition, complex behaviors, architectural constraints, topology emergence.
