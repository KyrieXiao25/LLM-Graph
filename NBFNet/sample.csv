2440,"Title: Quinlan, 1990 J.R. Quinlan. Learning logical definitions from relations. Machine Learning, First-order theory revision. In","Abstract: We describe a ranked-model semantics for if-then rules admitting exceptions, which provides a coherent framework for many facets of evidential and causal reasoning. Rule priorities are automatically extracted form the knowledge base to facilitate the construction and retraction of plausible beliefs. To represent causation, the formalism incorporates the principle of Markov shielding which imposes a stratified set of independence constraints on rankings of interpretations. We show how this formalism resolves some classical problems associated with specificity, prediction and abduction, and how it offers a natural way of unifying belief revision, belief update, and reasoning about actions.",Rule_Learning,"The source paper, ""Learning Boolean Concepts in the Presence of Many Irrelevant Features,"" addresses case-based learning amid irrelevant features, proposing the Oblivion algorithm for feature identification, particularly in interacting scenarios like parity concepts.

3231,Title: Irrelevant Features and the Subset Selection Problem,"Abstract: We address the problem of finding a subset of features that allows a supervised induction algorithm to induce small high-accuracy concepts. We examine notions of relevance and irrelevance, and show that the definitions used in the machine learning literature do not adequately partition the features into useful categories of relevance. We present definitions for irrelevance and for two degrees of relevance. These definitions improve our understanding of the behavior of previous subset selection algorithms, and help define the subset of features that should be sought. The features selected should depend not only on the features and the target concept, but also on the induction algorithm. We describe a method for feature subset selection using cross-validation that is applicable to any induction algorithm, and discuss experiments conducted with ID3 and C4.5 on artificial and real datasets.",Theory,"The source paper, ""Learning Boolean Concepts in the Presence of Many Irrelevant Features,"" introduces the Oblivion algorithm for case-based learning amidst irrelevant features, focusing on feature identification even in interacting scenarios like parity concepts.

10169,Title: Learning Boolean Concepts in the Presence of Many Irrelevant Features,"Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of case-based learning in the presence of irrelevant features. We review previous work on attribute selection and present a new algorithm, Oblivion, that carries out greedy pruning of oblivious decision trees, which effectively store a set of abstract cases in memory. We hypothesize that this approach will efficiently identify relevant features even when they interact, as in parity concepts. We report experimental results on artificial domains that support this hypothesis, and experiments with natural domains that show improvement in some cases but not others. In closing, we discuss the implications of our experiments, consider additional work on irrelevant features, and outline some directions for future research.",Theory,
954315,Title: Inductive Database Design,"Abstract: When designing a (deductive) database, the designer has to decide for each predicate (or relation) whether it should be defined extensionally or intensionally, and what the definition should look like. An intelligent system is presented to assist the designer in this task. It starts from an example database in which all predicates are defined extensionally.

144330,Title: Utilizing Prior Concepts for Learning,"Abstract: The inductive learning problem consists of learning a concept given examples and non-examples of the concept. To perform this learning task, inductive learning algorithms bias their learning method. Here we discuss biasing the learning method to use previously learned concepts from the same domain.

72908,Title: Applications of a logical discovery engine,"Abstract: The clausal discovery engine claudien is presented. claudien discovers regularities in data and is a representative of the inductive logic programming paradigm. As such, it represents data and regularities by means of first order clausal theories. Because the search space of clausal theories is larger than that of attribute value representation, claudien also accepts as input a declarative specification of the language bias, which determines the set of syntactically well-formed regularities. Whereas other papers on claudien focuss on the semantics or logical problem specification of claudien, on the discovery algorithm, or the PAC-learning aspects, this paper wants to illustrate the power of the resulting technique. In order to achieve this aim, we show how claudien can be used to learn 1) integrity constraints in databases, 2) functional dependencies and determinations, 3) properties of sequences, 4) mixed quantitative and qualitative laws, 5) reverse engineering, and 6) classification rules.",Rule_Learning,"The source paper, ""Learning Boolean Concepts in the Presence of Many Irrelevant Features,"" introduces the Oblivion algorithm for case-based learning with irrelevant features, focusing on feature identification even when features interact, like in parity concepts.
