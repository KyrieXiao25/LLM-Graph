As such, it represents data and regularities by means of first order clausal theories.

Whereas other papers on claudien focuss on the semantics or logical problem specification of claudien, on the discovery algorithm, or the PAC-learning aspects, this paper wants to illustrate the power of the resulting technique.

37483,Title: Learning Approximate Control Rules Of High Utility,"Abstract: One of the difficult problems in the area of explanation based learning is the utility problem; learning too many rules of low utility can lead to swamping, or degradation of performance. This paper introduces two new techniques for improving the utility of learned rules. The first technique is to combine EBL with inductive learning techniques to learn a better set of control rules; the second technique is to use these inductive techniques to learn approximate control rules. The two techniques are synthesized in an algorithm called approximating abductive explanation based learning (AxA-EBL). AxA-EBL is shown to improve substantially over standard EBL in several domains.",Case_Based,"The source paper, ""Learning Boolean Concepts in the Presence of Many Irrelevant Features,"" presents the Oblivion algorithm for case-based learning amidst irrelevant features, focusing on efficient feature identification, particularly in scenarios involving interacting features like parity concepts. It reports experimental results and discusses future research directions related to irrelevant features. The target paper, ""Learning Approximate Control Rules Of High Utility,"" addresses the utility problem in explanation-based learning, introducing techniques to improve rule utility by combining EBL with inductive learning and learning approximate control rules through AxA-EBL, showcasing substantial improvements over standard EBL in various domains.
